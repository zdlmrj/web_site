        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>My name is Marija Zdolsek and I am a back-end developer
          working @ <a href="https://indigo.ai/">Indigo.ai</a>, Milan based startup that works in
          Conversational Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <p>I started my career from a young age, by entering to a high school
           that was very focused on scientific subjects. It is where I was
           first exposed to computer science.</p>
        <p> After high school, I enrolled to
        University of Belgrade where I got my Bachelor degree in Mathematics
         after which I was able to continue my specialization at
         Politecnico di Milano and in 2018 I graduated with Master degree in
          Mathematical Engineering.</p>
        <p>I started to work in Indigo.ai, immediately after I graduated at
          Politecnico di Milano, I started as an Machin Learning Intern,
          but after my stage I decided to change my job role and to focus
          more on developing virtual assistants.</p>

          <h3>Work Skills</h3>
          <p>During the high school and University  I was able to take Pascal,
            C and Java courses. The way I learned to code at the time was more
            theoretical, very focused on reading text books, taking notes in
            classes and writing pseudo code on tests. It was only when I first
          started working as a back-end developer at Indigo.ai that I really
          got the practice, actually coding. I personally work in PHP,
          Python, Elixir and MySQL.</p>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>I learned Web Developing on my own as a hobbie. I speak three
            languages Serbian (mother tongue), English and Italian. I am
          also interested in design and cooking. I love travelling and animals,
         especially dogs and goats. üòä</p>
